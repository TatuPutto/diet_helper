How to release:
- npm run browserify
- Move build/app.js to gh-pages branch.

TODO:
- Figure out a way to manage food translations in an easier way
- Allow links in food description. Or maybe have more detailed longer text with MD (?)
- Make it easier to make changes to foods
- Add google analytics
- Add google search console
- Figure out where to put images so that bundling is still easy
- Add contact form
- Go through translations and make sure they make sense
- search for foods by category (for example, legumes, fruits, meat etc...)
- Change food list by diet
